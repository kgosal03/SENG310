Human Computer Interaction

In this course, I learned the basics of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on how people interact with various forms of technology, including web and desktop applications, wearables, apps, VR/AR systems, and home appliances. I explored the challenges people face in these interactions and the innovative strategies they use, which informed how designers create new technologies that address human needs such as functionality, usability, accessibility, and enjoyment.

I also learned about various methods to understand user behavior in relation to interfaces, including work activity analysis, task analysis, cognitive modeling, observational techniques, questionnaires, and unobtrusive measures. With this data, designers can propose new interaction design principles and develop prototypes, which are then evaluated by target users through techniques like cognitive walkthroughs, usability studies, and verbal protocol analysis.

Overall, the course covered the three main phases of HCI: (a) understanding users, (b) developing prototypes, and (c) evaluation. My focus was on applying the human-centered design process to improve and enhance human-computer interactions, rather than on developing technically robust software systems.
